# Jungkook Portfolio

This project is for the 5COSC026W module on Advanced Client-side Web Development. The goal is to create a personal portfolio website using HTML5 and CSS3, with a focus on proper semantic structure, efficient code, and responsive design. 

## Pages

The website will consist of the following pages:

### Main Page
This page will contain general information about the portfolio owner, as well as links to social media accounts. The page will be structured using HTML5 and styled with CSS3.

### About Page
This page will contain detailed information about the portfolio owner, their background, and their interests. The page will be structured using HTML5 and styled with CSS3.

### Personal Projects Page
This page will showcase the portfolio owner's personal projects or hobbies, using appropriate semantic elements. The page will contain two blog posts, each with a time element that includes the datetime attribute. The page will be structured using HTML5 and styled with CSS3.

### Contact Page
This page will contain a form for users to register for a newsletter and/or send a message to the portfolio owner. The form will use appropriate HTML5 form elements and have a structured layout. The page will be styled with CSS3.

## Styling

All pages will use a single external style sheet file, written in CSS3, to style the entire site. The style sheet will include the following features:

* Fonts specified using either @font-face or Google fonts, for consistent typography throughout the site.
* A color scheme that includes at least one semi-transparent color, as well as a variety of other colors.
* Shadows, text effects, and attribute selectors used to add depth and visual interest to the site.
* Pseudo elements with generated content used in at least one place on the site, for added visual interest.
* User action pseudo class, child combinator, structural selectors, negation pseudo class, nth pseudo class, and validity pseudo class used to target specific elements and create specific styling effects.
* Border, rounded corners, gradients, transforms, transitions, and animations used to create more complex styling effects.
* Specificity has been taken into consideration to ensure that the styles are applied correctly.
* The code includes good comments and indentation to make it easy to read and understand.

## Responsiveness

The portfolio will be designed with responsive web design in mind, using media queries to adjust the layout and styling for small screens. This will ensure that the site displays well on a range of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.

## Conclusion

This portfolio project showcases the portfolio owner's skills in HTML5, CSS3, and responsive web design. By creating a well-structured, visually interesting, and responsive site, the owner can demonstrate their ability to create engaging and effective web content.
